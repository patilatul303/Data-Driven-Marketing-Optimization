# Data-Driven-Marketing-Optimization

"Data-Driven Marketing Optimization through Naive Bayes and Twilio" is a dynamic Python project designed to revolutionize marketing strategies by intelligently leveraging customer purchase data. The project employs an array of technologies including Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Natural Language Processing (NLP), Naive Bayes, and Twilio to create a comprehensive system that predicts customer interests, sorts customers by categories, and facilitates targeted marketing through bulk SMS campaigns.

Features:

Data Collection and Storage: The project starts by collecting customer purchase data, storing it securely within the system's database.

Predictive Analytics with NLP and Naive Bayes: By utilizing NLP techniques and Naive Bayes classification, the project analyzes customer purchase history, reviews, and preferences to predict the categories of products that each customer might be interested in.

Customer Categorization: The system segments customers based on their predicted interests, creating lists of customers who share similar preferences in product categories.

Web Application with Flask, HTML, and CSS: The project features a user-friendly web interface built using Flask, HTML, and CSS. Shop owners can upload and manage customer data, view predictions, and initiate marketing campaigns.

Bulk SMS Marketing via Twilio: The system integrates with Twilio's API to send personalized bulk SMS messages to customers. Each message is tailored to the predicted interest of the customer, enhancing the effectiveness of marketing efforts.

Implementation:

Programming Languages: Python is the primary language used throughout the project.

Web Application: The front-end is developed using HTML and CSS, and Flask is employed for the back-end.

Predictive Modeling: NLP techniques and Naive Bayes classification algorithms are implemented using libraries like NLTK.

Integration: Twilio's API is integrated to facilitate bulk Messaging (SMS/WhatsApp)
